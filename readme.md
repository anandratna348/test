# ThreatGuard AI

AI-Powered Cyber Threat Intelligence and Intrusion Detection Platform

## Overview

ThreatGuard AI is a full-stack AI cybersecurity platform designed to detect, classify, and analyze malicious network traffic using Machine Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The platform combines:

* ML-based intrusion detection
* AI-generated cybersecurity investigation reports
* RAG-powered contextual analysis
* Interactive threat intelligence dashboard
* Modern full-stack deployment architecture

---

# Features

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Detects multiple network attack categories:

* DDoS Attacks
* Port Scanning
* Botnet Activity
* Benign Traffic

---

## AI-Powered Threat Analysis

Generates:

* Threat investigation reports
* Severity analysis
* Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
* Mitigation recommendations
* SOC analyst guidance

---

## RAG-Based Cyber Intelligence

Uses:

* FAISS Vector Database
* Cybersecurity Knowledge Base
* Ollama Local LLM Inference

to generate contextual cybersecurity reports.
